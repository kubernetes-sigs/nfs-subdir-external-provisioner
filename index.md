# NFS Subdirectory External Provisioner Helm Repository

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
$helm repo add nfs-subdir-external-provisioner https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner/
```

You can then run `helm search repo ` to see the charts.

For more details on installing NFS Subdirectory External Provisioner Helm please see the [chart readme](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner/blob/master/deploy/helm/README.md).
